## Demo Script for Video (5-7 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
**[Show Dashboard view]**

> "Hi, I'm Joel Suh, an MBA student at MIT Sloan and an At-Large Representative on the MIT Graduate Student Council. As a representative, I need to engage with hundreds of constituents across campus, but I can't physically be at every meeting, event, or conversation.
>
> That's why I built DelegateAI - an AI agent that attends meetings on my behalf, gathers constituent feedback, and helps me represent my constituents more effectively."

### Dashboard Overview (1 minute)
**[Highlight the stats cards at top]**

> "Here's my DelegateAI dashboard. At a glance, I can see:
> - My AI agent has attended 12 meetings this month
> - I've engaged with 847 constituents
> - We've identified 43 issues they care about
> - And I've saved 18.5 hours that I would have spent in meetings"

**[Scroll to Trending Issues section]**

> "The AI automatically analyzes all my constituent interactions and surfaces the most important issues. Right now, I can see:
> - Mental health resources is the #1 issue - mentioned 8 times across different departments
> - Housing affordability - mentioned 6 times
> - Research funding transparency
>
> For each issue, I can see which meetings or surveys it came from, and the AI helps me understand the scope of the problem."

### Meetings Feature (2 minutes)
**[Click on "Meetings" in sidebar]**

> "Let me show you how the meeting attendance works. Click on Meetings..."

**[Show the meetings list]**

> "My AI agent has been joining constituent meetings on my behalf. Here's today's MBA Town Hall that I couldn't attend because of class.
>
> The AI joined the Zoom, introduced itself as my delegate, took notes throughout the meeting, and generated this comprehensive summary."

**[Click "View Full Summary" on first meeting]**

> "Let me show you what the AI captured..."

**[Scroll through the modal]**

> "I get:
> - An executive summary of the meeting
> - Key topics with time breakdowns
> - Direct quotes from constituents
> - Action items prioritized by urgency
> - Sentiment analysis
> - And AI-generated recommendations for how I should follow up
>
> This is incredible because I get better information than if I had attended myself - I would have missed these quotes, forgotten the action items, and not seen the sentiment patterns."

**[Close modal, show EECS meeting]**

> "Here's another example - the EECS Department meeting from yesterday. Let me open this one..."

**[Click "View Full Summary" on EECS meeting]**

> "This one flagged as urgent because multiple students mentioned 3-4 week wait times for mental health counseling. The AI recognized this came up in other meetings too and marked it as a critical issue."

**[Close modal]**

### Constituent Feedback (1 minute)
**[Click "Constituent Feedback" in sidebar]**

> "Beyond attending meetings, DelegateAI also proactively gathers feedback from my constituents through surveys."

**[Show the stats and category breakdown]**

> "I've received 156 responses with an 82% response rate. The AI automatically categorizes responses:
> - 32% about mental health
> - 23% about housing
> - 18% funding concerns
> - And so on..."

**[Scroll to feedback items]**

> "I can read individual responses, and the AI tags them by topic and urgency. This PhD student in Biology wrote about the mental health wait times - marked as urgent. An MBA student about housing costs - high priority.
>
> The AI helps me understand not just what people are saying, but what requires immediate action."

### AI Insights (1.5 minutes)
**[Click "Insights" in sidebar]**

> "Now here's where it gets really powerful. The Insights view uses AI to find patterns across ALL my constituent interactions."

**[Show the insight cards]**

> "The AI has identified that mental health is an urgent action required - it's been mentioned 8 times in the past week across multiple departments, affecting PhD students especially.
>
> And here's what's brilliant - it gives me specific recommended actions:
> - Bring this to the next GSC meeting as a priority item
> - Request a meeting with the Mental Health Services director
> - Survey students about specific needs
> - Explore peer support programs
>
> The AI isn't just collecting information - it's helping me be a better representative by telling me what to do about it."

**[Scroll to Pattern Analysis]**

> "It even does pattern analysis. For example, it recognized that mental health concerns are mentioned across Sloan, EECS, Biology, and Physics - suggesting this is a university-wide systemic issue, not department-specific. That changes how I should approach solving it."

### Market Opportunity (1 minute)
**[Return to Dashboard]**

> "So why am I building this? Because this problem exists everywhere representation happens.
>
> There are 100,000 student government representatives across universities globally. Every single one faces the same challenge - you can't be everywhere at once.
>
> But beyond student government, this applies to:
> - Professional association board members
> - Community board representatives
> - Nonprofit board directors
> - Even elected officials
>
> That's a $500 million total addressable market for a tool that helps representatives actually represent their constituents effectively.
>
> I'm starting with student government because I'm the customer - I understand the problem deeply. Success at MIT will prove the concept, then we expand to other universities and eventually all representative roles."

### Closing (30 seconds)
**[Show Dashboard with stats]**

> "DelegateAI is solving a fundamental problem in representative democracy: how do you engage with constituents at scale while maintaining quality and depth?
>
> My AI agent gives me superpowers - I can attend multiple meetings simultaneously, never miss constituent feedback, and use AI to identify the patterns I'd miss manually.
>
> The result? Better representation, happier constituents, and more informed decisions.
>
> Thanks for watching. If you're interested in learning more or want to try DelegateAI for your organization, reach out to me at MIT."

## Video Recording Tips

> 7/ Starting with student gov (I'm the customer), then expanding. If you're interested or want to be a beta tester, DM me. Demo: [link]"

## Questions You Might Get (FAQ)

**Q: Is this really AI or just transcription?**
A: It's real AI analysis. We use Claude API to analyze transcripts, identify themes, extract sentiment, recognize patterns across meetings, and generate actionable recommendations. It's doing reasoning, not just transcribing.

**Q: Do people object to an AI attending their meetings?**
A: The AI always announces itself at the start: "Hi, I'm DelegateAI representing Joel. I'm here to listen and take notes." Transparency is key. We find people appreciate that their rep is making an effort to engage even when they can't attend physically.

**Q: What about privacy and recording consent?**
A: Zoom bots must announce themselves and recording must be consented to. We're building with privacy-first approach - encrypted storage, clear data policies, and compliance with university/organizational rules.

**Q: How is this different from just recording Zoom meetings?**
A: Three ways: (1) AI analyzes and summarizes - saves hours of review time, (2) AI finds patterns ACROSS meetings - sees systemic issues, (3) AI generates specific action recommendations - tells you what to do about it.

**Q: What's your business model?**
A: SaaS subscriptions. Individual reps $29/month, teams $99/month, institutions $299/month. Low enough for student gov budgets, high enough to be sustainable.

**Q: Why will this succeed?**
A: (1) I'm the customer - founder/market fit, (2) Real problem - every rep struggles with this, (3) No competition - no AI solution exists, (4) Large TAM - representative roles everywhere, (5) Perfect timing - AI + remote work trends align.

**Q: When can I try it?**
A: Building MVP now (6-week timeline). Beta testing at MIT starting next semester. Want to be a beta tester? [Get their contact info]
