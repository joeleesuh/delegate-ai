# DelegateAI: Business Case & Market Analysis

## The Problem (Validated)

### Your Personal Pain Point
As MIT GSC At-Large Representative:
- Represent ~6,000 graduate students across all MIT departments
- Can't physically attend every departmental meeting, student org event, or town hall
- Miss critical constituent feedback due to time/location constraints
- Difficult to track issues across disparate conversations
- Hard to identify patterns in what constituents care about

### Broader Market Pain
This problem exists everywhere representation happens:
- **Student government**: 5,000+ universities globally
- **Professional associations**: Millions of board members
- **Community boards**: Every city/town has multiple boards
- **Non-profit boards**: 1.5M+ nonprofits in US alone
- **Elected officials**: Every level of government

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market (TAM) 
**Conservative estimate for student government alone:**
- 5,000 universities worldwide
- Average 20 student government positions per university
- = 100,000 potential individual users
- At $29/month = $34.8M annual revenue potential

**Broader representative roles:**
- 500,000+ board positions in US nonprofits
- 500,000+ elected officials globally
- 2M+ professional association leaders
- **Total TAM: $500M+ annually**

### Beachhead Market: Student Government
**Why start here:**
1. **You're the customer** - Deep understanding of pain points
2. **Easy to reach** - Clear channels (student gov associations, conferences)
3. **Tech-savvy** - Early adopters, comfortable with AI
4. **Budget exists** - Student gov orgs have budgets ($500-5000/year)
5. **Network effects** - Reps talk to reps at other schools
6. **Proof of concept** - Success at MIT → credibility everywhere

### Service Addressable Market (SAM)
**Phase 1**: Top 100 research universities (R1)
- ~100 universities
- ~20 reps each = 2,000 users
- At $29/month = $696K ARR potential

**Phase 2**: All US universities with student government
- ~4,000 universities
- Conservative 10 reps each = 40,000 users
- At $29/month = $13.9M ARR potential

## Competitive Analysis

### Current "Solutions"
1. **Manual attendance** - Doesn't scale, opportunity cost high
2. **Asking for notes** - Inconsistent, second-hand information
3. **Email surveys** - Low response rates, no context
4. **Office hours** - Limited reach, self-selection bias
5. **Social media polls** - Not representative, lacks depth

### Competitive Landscape
| Solution | Pros | Cons | Price |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Otter.ai | Good transcription | No attendance, no analysis | $0-17/mo |
| SurveyMonkey | Easy surveys | No meeting integration | $0-99/mo |
| Zoom recordings | Built-in | Manual review time-consuming | Included |
| **DelegateAI** | Attends + analyzes + surveys | New, unproven | $29/mo |

**Unique Value Proposition:**
We're the only solution that actually "represents" you at events you can't attend.

### Barriers to Entry
**Low initially:**
- Technology stack is accessible (Zoom API + LLM)
- No proprietary data required to start

**Increases over time:**
- Constituent data becomes valuable
- Pattern recognition improves with usage
- Integration partnerships (Zoom, universities)
- Network effects (more reps = more valuable)

## Why This Can Work

### 1. Real, Validated Problem
- You experience this pain daily
- Every rep you talk to will nod their head
- No good solution exists today

### 2. Perfect Timing
- LLMs are powerful enough for good analysis
- Zoom fatigue makes bots more acceptable
- AI acceptance is at all-time high
- Remote/hybrid meetings are norm

### 3. Clear Path to Revenue
- B2B SaaS model proven
- Customers have budgets
- Value is obvious and measurable
- Low cost to serve

### 4. Expansion Opportunities
**Horizontal:**
- Student government → Professional associations
- Student government → Community boards
- Student government → Elected officials

**Vertical:**
- Meeting bot → Full constituent management platform
- Analytics → Decision support system
- Individual → Institution-wide deployment

### 5. Founder-Market Fit
- You're the target customer
- MBA at top program (Sloan)
- Active in student government
- Understand both problem and market

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**Primary: SaaS Subscriptions**
- Individual: $29/month
- Team (5-10): $99/month
- Institution: $299/month
- Enterprise: Custom

**Secondary (Future):**
- Analytics add-on: $15/month
- Premium support: $50/month
- API access for institutions: Custom
- White-label for universities: Custom

### Unit Economics (Projected)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- Early: $0 (word of mouth, your network)
- Scaled: $200-500 (content, conferences, partnerships)

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Assume 18-month retention (academic terms)
- $29/month × 18 months = $522
- LTV:CAC ratio = 2-5x (healthy)

**Cost to Serve (Monthly per user):**
- Zoom API: ~$5
- Transcription: ~$3
- Claude API: ~$4
- Infrastructure: ~$2
- **Total: ~$14** (48% gross margin at $29 price point)

### Funding Strategy

**Bootstrap Phase (0-6 months):**
- Build MVP with personal time/resources
- Use MIT resources where possible
- Target: Working product with 10 beta users

**Pre-seed (6-12 months):**
- $100-250K from angel investors or micro-VCs
- MIT alumni network, edtech angels
- Use for: Hiring 1-2 developers, initial marketing

**Seed (12-24 months):**
- $1-2M from seed VCs
- Metrics to hit: 500+ paying users, $175K ARR
- Use for: Team growth, expand to adjacent markets

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3)
**Target:** Just you
- Build MVP
- Use for actual GSC work
- Document impact and learnings
- Refine based on real use

### Phase 2: MIT Expansion (Months 4-6)
**Target:** Other MIT GSC reps and student leaders
- Offer free to all MIT GSC members
- Gather testimonials and case studies
- Iterate based on feedback
- Goal: 20 active users at MIT

### Phase 3: University Network (Months 7-12)
**Target:** Student government at peer universities
- Reach out to GSC equivalents at Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, etc.
- Offer free/discounted pilots
- Attend student gov conferences (ASGA, etc.)
- Goal: 100 users across 10 universities

### Phase 4: Revenue & Scale (Months 13-24)
**Target:** All R1 universities
- Launch paid tiers
- Content marketing (blog posts on effective representation)
- Partnership with student gov associations
- Goal: 500 paying users, $175K ARR

## Key Success Factors

1. **Solve your own problem first** - If it works for you, it'll work for others
2. **Start small, prove value** - One happy user > ten confused users
3. **Leverage your network** - MIT → peer schools → broader market
4. **Focus on outcomes** - Better representation, not just cool tech
5. **Build for scale** - Architecture should support 10,000+ users

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Privacy concerns kill adoption | High | Clear consent, strong security, compliance-first |
| Zoom changes API/policy | High | Diversify to Teams, Google Meet; build relationships |
| Low constituent acceptance | Medium | Always announce bot, show value to constituents too |
| Competitors emerge quickly | Medium | Move fast, build network effects, deep integrations |
| Market too niche | Low | Large TAM beyond student gov; proven representative problem |

## Why Investors Would Care

1. **Large TAM** - $500M+ across all representative roles
2. **Real problem** - Founder is customer, deep domain expertise
3. **B2B SaaS** - Proven business model, predictable revenue
4. **Network effects** - Value increases with more users
5. **Expansion paths** - Clear horizontal and vertical opportunities
6. **Timely** - AI capabilities + remote work trends align perfectly
7. **Social impact** - Better democracy and representation

## The Ask (Future)

**From MIT community:**
- Beta testers (GSC members)
- Technical mentorship (MIT CSAIL, Media Lab)
- Early feedback and iteration

**From advisors:**
- Domain expertise in edtech, govtech, AI
- Network introductions
- Go-to-market strategy

**From investors (when ready):**

- Seed: $1-2M for team and scale

---

**Bottom Line:**
This solves a real problem you experience daily, has a large addressable market, and leverages emerging AI capabilities perfectly. Start by solving it for yourself, then expand to every representative who needs to engage constituents at scale.
